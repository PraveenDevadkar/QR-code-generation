# QR-code-generation
This project generates QR codes for images, audio, and text, encrypting data with DES, AES, and Diffie-Hellman for secure transmission. DES and AES ensure confidentiality, while Diffie-Hellman facilitates key exchange. QR codes enhance privacy and security in image, audio, and text transmission.
